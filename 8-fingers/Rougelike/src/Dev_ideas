The bat should rotate around a randomly selected poin at a random radius that changes every second, instead of divebombing player

Each stair-room should have a boss that if deafeated upgrades one of a
players movement speed max 5?,
weapon damage unlimited maximum?,
weapon recharge time 7 frames minimum?,
Number of bullets allowed no max needed,
maximum hp no max needed,
number of bullets fired in a spread per shot max 5?

enemies should gain stats, hp and damage and some movement speed per dungon level

health pickus should be implimented as enemies that cannot move and are placed leagally by player rules and give -damage on pickup

traps that fire fireballs at set interavalls in set directions cannot die

slime that moves at 90 deg angles when he encounters a wall should be pushed back his speed and pick a random direction


boss ideas
-bigger eyeball that fires mutiple fireballs at once, or he could spawn a regualr eyeball

-giant slime that charges and destroys obstacles in path leaving a slowing trail behind him

-necromancer teleports around and summons bats en mass


i should split enemy and boss scripts off from main as they will ballon in size as fetures are added
