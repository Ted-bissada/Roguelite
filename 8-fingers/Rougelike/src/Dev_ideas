Each stair-room should have a boss that if defeated upgrades the player -easy would work by directly altering player stats
-players movement speed max 5?,
-weapon damage unlimited maximum?,
-weapon recharge time 7 frames minimum?,
-Number of bullets allowed no max needed,
-maximum hp no max needed,
-number of bullets fired in a spread per shot max 5?
system
-if the player wants they can ignore the boss and go for the ladder -easy
-the ladder does not appear until the boss is dead -medium

Use sprites for UI system not only do they look better text is really slow on canvas

enemies should gain stats, hp and damage and some movement speed per dungeon level -easy

health pickups should be implemented as enemies that cannot move and are placed legally by player rules and give negative damage on hit -medium
i would need to check hp pack placment against all existing room objects

traps that fire fireballs at set intervals in set directions cannot die -easy

slime that moves at 90 deg angles when he encounters a wall should be pushed back his speed and turn 90 deg -medium

create sytem to control frequency of various features similar to the one controlling enemy spawn frequency
-turn the frequency of the lakes/puddles way down they are obnoxious-easy
have different frequencies of featues and enemies for different floors ?depending on bosses? -medium
-for example have a floor with a slime boss spawn extra slimes and lakes

boss ideas
-bigger eyeball that fires mutiple fireballs at once, or he could spawn a regualr eyeball - Done spawns fireballs, necromancer taking over swarm boss role

-giant slime that charges and destroys obstacles in path leaving a slowing trail behind him -hard

-necromancer teleports' around and summons bats en mass -easy


i should split enemy and boss scripts off from main as it will balloon in size as features are added -easy
