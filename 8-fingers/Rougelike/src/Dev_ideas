Each stair-room should have a boss that if defeated upgrades the player -easy would work by directly altering player stats
-players movement speed max 5?,
-weapon damage unlimited maximum?,
-weapon recharge time 7 frames minimum?,
-Number of bullets allowed no max needed,
-maximum hp no max 20?,
-number of bullets fired in a spread per shot max 5?
system
-maybe have boss explode into pickups on death and have them drift towards player
-if the player wants they can ignore the boss and go for the ladder -easy
-the ladder does not appear until the boss is dead -set flag on floor creation to hide stairs have boss death remove flag

a transition animation for going down ladders to make it less abrupt and to cover the frame hitch generating a new floor causes
-could be done with a flag similar to the gameOver flag to disable player movement and then re-enable after new floor is loaded

Use sprites for UI system not only do they look better text is really slow on canvas - started

enemies should gain stats, hp and damage and some movement speed per dungeon level -easy -UNIMPORTANT

health pickups should be implemented as enemies that negative damage on hit
-i would need to check hp pack placement against all existing room objects -medium
-i could make hp pickups follow bat movement rules -easy
-when enemies dies they have a chance to spawn an hp pickup that just moves towards you it can be destroyed if you shoot it by accident it does
negative dmg on contact but if your current hp > maxhp current hp = maxhp

traps that fire fireballs at set intervals in set directions cannot die -easy -IMPORTANT

slime that moves at 90 deg angles when he encounters a wall should be pushed back his speed and turn 90 deg -medium -IMPORTANT

create sytem to control frequency of various features similar to the one controlling enemy spawn frequency -UNIMPORTANT
-turn the frequency of the lakes/puddles down they are obnoxious-easy
have different frequencies of featues and enemies for different floors ?depending on bosses?
-for example have a floor with a slime boss spawn extra slimes and lakes

boss ideas
-giant slime that charges and destroys obstacles in path leaving a slowing trail behind him -hard
-necromancer teleports' around and summons bats en mass -easy

boss hp bars
-have the boss draw to ui
-have the boss set a flag

i should split enemy and boss scripts off from main as it will balloon in size as features are added -easy -UNIMPORTANT

implement treasure chests or some-sort of bonus for exploring floors -IMPORTANT
-can have incentives in chests -maybe a shield that gives temporary invincibility or absorbs some hits
-can have exp granted for killing enemies -maybe give max hp, and move speed on level up while bossees give out weapon bonuses
-could disable map to force exploration - i dislike this idea

-have enemy and player fireballs die on contact with terrain ?
